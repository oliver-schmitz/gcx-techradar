        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p>The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called ring assignment. We
            use four rings with the following semantics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> — Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
                scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our Grandcentrix production environment, low risk and
                recommended being widely used
            </li>
            <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> — Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
                real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
                technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
                knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> — Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
                technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS
                technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You
                will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams
                that have started a prototyping effort
            </li>
            <li><strong>HOLD</strong> — Technologies not recommended being used for new projects. Technologies that we
                think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
                but usually can be continued for existing projects.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>
            <p>
                The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Zalando to pick the best
                technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experiences,
                to reflect on decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">Based on the pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech
                Radar highlights changes in the industry that are pertinent to software development — changes that
                we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
        <p>
            The Tech Radar is maintained by our Engineers — who facilitate and drive the technology selection
            discussions at Grandcentrix across the Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies to rings is the
            outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution
            for all Engineering teams at Grandcentrix and depends on their active participation to share lessons
            learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.
